#Green: Represents the predicted masks for the detected objects. This is often used to fill the area where the model predicts an object is present.


#Blue: Used for drawing bounding boxes or contour lines around detected objects. It might also be used to indicate class-specific boundaries or highlight different classes.


#Violet Overlays: The areas that are annotated as objects in the dataset. This shows what the ground truth labels are, allowing you to compare them with the modelâ€™s predictions.
